🌱 AI Career Counselor Agent for Rural Youth
Bridging dreams and opportunities through technology

🌟 Our Mission
We believe every young person deserves a clear path to their future, regardless of where they grow up. This project aims to empower rural students with personalized career guidance using AI—because geography shouldn't limit ambition.

💔 The Challenge
Rural youth face unique hurdles:

Limited access to career mentors and updated resources
Information gaps about colleges, scholarships, and government schemes
Uncertainty about how local skills connect to real-world opportunities
This often leads to talented students settling for less than they deserve.
🚀 Our Solution

Listens to your interests, skills, and local context
Guides you toward personalized career paths using smart AI (NLP + RAG)
Connects you to colleges, vocational training, scholarships, and nearby opportunities
